## Description

HireLav is a lavender-themed recruitment website for stress-free hiring. Yes, the recruiters are stressed out too from the hiring process? Managing multiple jobs and 100s of applications could be exhausting and most of the applicant trackers are either too complex to use or least exciting to work with. HireLav provides an easy interface and a relaxing theme to breeze through all the recruitment phases.

This repo is the frontend of the project and is deployed at [hirelav.netlify.app](https://hirelav.netlify.app/). The repo for the server is [mkchahal/hirelav-server](https://github.com/mkchahal/hirelav-server) and it is deployed at [hirelav-server.herokuapp.com](https://hirelav-server.herokuapp.com/).
